## Why This Exists

Code is commoditized. Distribution is the moat. This system handles distribution.

Every channel has 8 specialized agents. They research, analyze, strategize, create, deploy, and learn. Performance data feeds back into a shared `marketing_knowledge` brain, so every channel benefits from what the others learn.

6 Infrastructure agents continuously scan for new tools, monitor industry changes, optimize costs, audit the system, deploy upgrades, and generate reports.

## The Shared Brain

The `marketing_knowledge` table is the central intelligence layer. Every channel's Performance Learning agent writes proven insights here, and every channel's Analysis, Strategy, and Creation agents read from it.

This means:
- An insight from a high-performing Meta ad (e.g., "pain-point hooks outperform question hooks") is available to the SEO Content Creator and Social Media Strategist
- SEO keyword research (e.g., "emergency plumber near me has 10x volume") informs ad copy and social captions
- Social media engagement data (e.g., "before/after posts get 3x engagement") informs ad creative direction

## How It's Different

|  | Marketing Agents | claude-seo | claude-ads | Marketing skill libraries |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agents | 30 | 13 | 6 | 0 |
| Channels | 3 (ads + SEO + social) | SEO only | Ads only | Individual skills |
| Shared brain | Yes | No | No | No |
| Cross-channel learning | Yes | No | No | No |
| End-to-end pipeline | Yes | Audit only | Audit only | No |
| Self-improving | Yes (Infrastructure agents) | No | No | No |

## Works With

Designed to integrate with tools you already have:
- [claude-seo](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-seo) — technical SEO data
- [claude-ads](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-ads) — ad auditing
- Adspirer MCP — live Meta/Google/TikTok data
- Playwright MCP — browser automation
- Supabase — database for the shared brain
- Any MCP server in your stack

## Setup the Brain (Optional)

The shared brain uses a Supabase table. To enable cross-session learning:

1. Create a Supabase project (free tier works)
2. Run `schema.sql` in the SQL editor
3. Connect Supabase MCP to Claude Code

Without Supabase, agents still work — they just don't persist learnings across sessions.

## Connecting to Meta Ads (Optional)

If you want the agents to actually deploy ads to Meta, you'll need to set up a Meta App. It sounds more intimidating than it is — took me about 15 minutes.

1) Go to developers.facebook.com and create a new app. Pick "Business" as the type. Give it whatever name you want.

2) Once the app is created, go to App Settings > Basic and grab your App ID and App Secret. You'll need these later.

3) Now go to Business Settings in your Meta Business Suite (business.facebook.com). Under Users > System Users, create a new system user. Give it Admin access.

4) Click "Generate New Token" on that system user. Select your app from the dropdown, then tick these permissions:
   - ads_management
   - ads_read
   - pages_read_engagement
   - pages_manage_posts

5) Copy that token. That's your META_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN.

6) While you're in Business Settings, go to Accounts > Ad Accounts and grab your ad account ID. It looks like act_123456789.

7) Create a .env file in your project root:

```
META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=act_123456789
META_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN=your_long_token_here
META_PAGE_ID=your_facebook_page_id
```

That's it. The Campaign Deployment agent reads from this file. All campaigns deploy PAUSED — nothing spends money until you manually activate it in Ads Manager.

If you don't want to deal with any of this, the Adspirer MCP handles the auth flow for you. You just connect your ad account through their interface and the agents call it as an MCP tool instead.

## Uninstall

```bash
cd marketing-agents && bash uninstall.sh
```
